In this project I translated 3 C programs into assembly using MIPS. 
These three programs have different functions, from traditional iterative programming,
to recursive programs as well. 

This program was interesting because it helped me understand
how memory was allocated on the stack, from function calls, passing through parameters, 
and local variables. I learned to appreciate how higher level languages would do this
automatically, and gained a deeper understanding of how stack pushed and popped for memory.
